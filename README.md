# OsuCleaner

I am developing a program in C# with WPF that will list all the maps in the Osu! folder and categorize them into types like Osu, Taiko, Catch, and Mania. The user will then be able to select a specific category and delete all the maps from that category at once, which is much more efficient compared to manually deleting each map one by one in Osu!.

The goal is to free up disk space so that more maps of the user's preferred style can be downloaded. The program will also identify maps that contain different game modes within the same folder. For example, if a map has both a Mania and an Osu version, the program will keep the Osu version and only delete the Mania one.

I am using C# for the logic and WPF for the graphical user interface.
